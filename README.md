# Java Playground

I've decided to learn Java! After quickly going through the [Codecademy Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java), I now need to practice what I've learnt by making lots of small projects, and here they are.

I'll be taking projects from [this list](https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/) and just projects that I think of. Each project will be in a new folder, with a number in the order that I completed them in (e.g `1-HelloWorld` was my first project, `2-ReverseString` was my second project, etc...)
